### Description

With this application you can actually make yourself translucent, and see right through yourself in real-time. Meaning it's like you really are a ghost! The code can generate the translucency very fast and therefore can keep up with the webcam refreshing every 50 millisenonds, appearing real-time. I came up with this idea after trying to come up with ideas of making some some use of green-screen technology, but it turned out to be this. This is the second upload of it, as I have made some minor changes to the code and added a status-bar as well as made it so you can select a location of your saved images, instead of it just saving to C:\temp.bmp. I have also commented almost every line of the code so you know what's going on all through the code. Also I have actually reduced the filesize of the ZIP from 22 KB to 5 KB, and there's more stuff in it... PLEASE leave lots of feedback if you look at this. I only submit things to keep Planet Source Code alive, and to see whatever everyone thinks about my ideas and what the end-results are. So PLEASE leave me lots of feedback on what you think. Enjoy everyone.
